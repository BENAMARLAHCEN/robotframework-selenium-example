# My First Robot Framework Project

This is my first project using Robot Framework, an open-source automation framework that implements the keyword-driven approach for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD).

## Installation

Before running the tests, make sure you have Robot Framework installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install robotframework
